# sfopt
Reduce Surfaceflinger's power consumption by minimizing refresh rate interruptions. It is a module that must be used together with Uperf, but can be used separately for users who would like to save energy but do not want to use [Uperf](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/Uperf) (due to lack of compatibility or something like that).
